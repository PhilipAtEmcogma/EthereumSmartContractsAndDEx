This project aims to build a Ethereum ERC20 compatable DEx, which allows user to swap Eth to ERC20 compatiable token and vice versa.
The first iteration of the DEx will only swap Eth to token and vice versa, but not directly between two ERC20 compatiable tokens,
although this function might be added at later stage.
The DEx are built using javascrit, truffle, openzepplin and are using solidity 0.8.17.

This project is broken down to several stages, first by build a Wallet that stores the balances of tokens.
After the wallet is built, the DEx functionality will be implemented.
And after it, I will look into how to swap ERC20 tokens directly similar to Uniswap, but that will only come after I've learn enough on how to 
do so safely and have adequate experience and insights to implement them practically.
